# Python_Bank-segmentation


In this project, I set out to explore bank customer data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marusagar/bank-customer-attrition-insights) and uncover hidden patterns using clustering techniques. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means, I was able to reduce the complexity of the [dataset](https://github.com/ksmilda/Python_Bank-segmentation/blob/main/Bank-Customer-Attrition-Insights-Data.xlsx) and group customers into meaningful segments. Take a look at the documentation on Jupiter notebook [here](https://github.com/ksmilda/Python_Bank-segmentation/blob/main/kmeans-bank.ipynb).

## The Process
1. Importing the Data
2. Pre process data using PCA
3. Sillhoute score
4. K-Means analysis
5. The Result
