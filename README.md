# Python_Bank-segmentation


In this project, I set out to explore customer data and uncover hidden patterns using clustering techniques. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means, I was able to reduce the complexity of the dataset and group customers into meaningful segments.

## The Process
1. Importing the Data
2. Pre process data using PCA
3. Sillhoute score
4. K-Means analysis
5. The Result
